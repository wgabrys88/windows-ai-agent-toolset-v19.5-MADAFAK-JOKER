Recently, I have been observing the screen to understand how to interact with the application. The task is stated as 'to complete the rectangular shape by "mouse drag"'. There's a current drawing of an L-shape in Paint. On the right side, there's a FRANZ MEMORY window showing that it is ready for observation and contains instructions about using mouse or keyboard controls to perform tasks. The main application area displays this instruction text clearly at the top. The task state seems clear from the start, with no explicit button visible yet. I'm in EXECUTION mode as indicated by the blue button.

It has two buttons at the bottom: PAUSE and OBSERVATION, which are highlighted as the target for the next action. Mode is in EXECUTION (BLUE button).
